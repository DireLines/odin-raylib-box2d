# odin-raylib-box2d
basic example of using these together post box2d v3.0

## Build / Run

This needs a build step to generate a texture atlas (using a slightly modified version of https://github.com/karl-zylinski/atlas-builder)

`make` will generate the atlas and then run the game
`make atlas` will just generate the atlas

After the atlas is created,
`odin run .` will rebuild and run the game
